# Image Similarity Calculation (AASD 4015 Project 2)
#### This project is done by: 1. Chun Cheong MAK (101409987) & 2. Hei Yuet LEE (101409639)

# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to explore a way to build a new hybrid CNN classifer by calculating the cosine similarity of feature vectors of 2 different images. 

The project is inspired by the concept of ensemble learning discussed in the AASD 4000 - Machine Learning I and an article about image search using cosine similarity of feature vectors of 2 different images. 

After building the new hybrid CNN classifer, it will be compared with other CNN transfer learning models.
